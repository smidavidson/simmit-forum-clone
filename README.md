# Simmit: The Simple Forum 

Simmit is a simple Reddit-like forum built with **React.JS, Tailwind CSS, and Vite**.\
**Live Demo:** https://app.simmitforum.click/

The backend was built using **Node.js, Express.js and express-session** using **PSQL** for persistent data storage and **Redis** for session management and caching.\
More information for the backend can be found here: https://github.com/smidavidson/simmit-forum-backend

Currently the site is filled with example posts I copied from Reddit, but feel free to post anything you want to test out the site.\
**Note:** Email confirmation is currently disabled, so you can freely sign up to test with a temporary email account.
